## Business problems

Software provides solutions to business problems, both at the business domain and subdomain level.

Developers need to understand the domain at a basic level to build effective software solutions.

Without a understanding of the domain and domain language, the software becomes a mere translation of business requirements without a real understanding of the business domain.

Knowledge sharing and effective communication between developers and domain experts is key to understand the problem.

## Communication

People working on a business problem need to be aligned on the same domain language.

Do we all agree on what problem we are trying to solve? The requirements? The domain?

Most commonly, business-requirements are "translated" and "fed" to developers that need to implement a solution for a problem.

By using an ubiquitous domain language, all actors involved have a good starting point to address the business problem talking the same language and sharing an basic understanding of the domain.

## What is Ubiquitous Language?

The concept is simple: a common domain language that is used by everyone involved in the problem.

Without relying on hazy translations and understandings passed onto developers, the problem can be solved in a more effective way, resembling the problem applied to the business domain.

Each term in your ubiquitous language dictionary should have only one meaning and be explicit.

## Model of the Business Domain

Models are a representation/abstraction of thing or process in the domain. Models are not a copy of the real world, instead it has just enough information to solve a problem.

A model is a construct that helps use make sense of a complex system.

When creating the ubiquitous language you are modeling your business domain using the knowledge of domain experts.

The only way to effectively capture domain knowledge is to have continous conversations with domain experts, and updating the domain language accordingly to new findings.
