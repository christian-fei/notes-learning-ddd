**What Is a business domain?**

A company’s main area of activity

A company can operate in multiple business domains

Companies may change their business domains often


**What is a subdomain?**

A fine-grained area of business activity

All of the subdomains together are necessary for a company to be able to compete in its business domains.


## Different types of subdomains

Subdomains have different strategic/business value.

In DDD we distinguish 3 types of subdomains:

- Core
- Generic
- Supporting


### Core Subdomains

What a company does differently to compete with other businesses.

E.g. Uber, Google search

Provides competitive advantage

Competitive advantage is achieved through inventions, optimisations, knowledge and intellectual property.

Should be as hard as possible for a competitor to copy, the company’s profitability depends on it.


**Complexity**

To maintain competitive advantage, a business must understanding its business domain and make it hard for others to copy the company’s solution

**Sources of competitive advantage**

Not all subdomains are necessarily technical.

The core subdomain could be the result of manual labour/product.

### Generic subdomains

Business activities that all companies are doing in same/similar ways.

Generic subdomains do not provide competitive advantage.

Are more complex to implement.

E.g. authentication, a online shop etc.

### Supporting subdomains

Support the company’s business.

Supporting subdomains do not provide a competitive advantage.

Distinctive feature: Supporting subdomains are simple to implement.

e.g. REST API, ETL etc.

**Difference between core and supporting subdomains**

When it’s difficult to understand if it’s a core or supporting subdomain, complexity can help to differentiate.

Can it be turned into a side-business? Would someone pay for it on its own? -> core subdomain

Is it simpler and cheaper to solve the problem on your own with your implementation, or by integrating an external solution? -> supporting subdomain

**Volatility**

Core subdomains can change often -> Core subdomains emerge and evolve over time.

Time and money is invested in making core subdomains more reliable, more competitive and optimised.

Supporting subdomains do not change often. No competitive advantage. Provide little business value

Generic subdomains can change over time (e.g. bug fixes, patches, new solutions etc.)
